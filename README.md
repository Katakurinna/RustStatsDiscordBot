# Rust Statistics by Katakurinna
## Rust discord bot for get players stats.
Need [RustAdmin Desktop Client](https://www.rustadmin.com/) to work.

### Now working:
```
!podio
```
`Returns an embedded message with the 5 people who have killed the most on the server.`

### TODO:
```
!stats <steamid> / <username>
```
`Returns a embedded message with player info (KDR, most killed, most died, pve deaths, last kill, date of last kill, date of last death).`

```
Generate static embedded message with podium, update on emoji reaction
```
`Generate a static message with podion, update every five minutes, and when player react to the message.`

```
Multiple server and custom config to every server
```
`Permit multiple server with custom config.`

```
Save stats and update every five minutes or custom config selected.
